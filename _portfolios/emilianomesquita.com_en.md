 I decided not to use Wordpress nor another CMS to schew the need for a database. For a while the site was just plain HTML + CSS, with the contact form written in jQuery + PHP (with sendmail). I eventually wanted a way to separate the content from the layout, so I used the static site generator Jekyll to rewrite the site.
